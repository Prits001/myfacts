    "The genetic code is the set of rules that determines how the sequence of nucleotides in DNA is translated into the sequence of amino acids in proteins.",
    "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants and other organisms convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into organic compounds and oxygen.",
    "Cellular respiration is the process by which living organisms convert organic compounds and oxygen into energy, carbon dioxide, and water.",
    "The human body is composed of various organ systems, including the digestive, respiratory, circulatory, nervous, and reproductive systems, among others.",
    "The study of genetics involves the analysis of genes and their inheritance patterns, as well as the diagnosis and treatment of genetic diseases.",
    "Biotechnology is the use of biological processes, organisms, or systems to develop new technologies and products for human benefit, such as genetically modified crops, vaccines, and biofuels.",
